      Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani advocate for women's education, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. She is well-known for advocating for human rights, particularly the education of women and children in her native Swat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the Pakistani Taliban occasionally forbade girls from attending school. On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in Swat District after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for her. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that she may have become "the most famous teenager in the world." Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of 50 leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a "fatwƒÅ" against those who tried to kill her. The Pakistani Taliban were internationally denounced by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups.
