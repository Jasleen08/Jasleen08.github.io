  <h1>DONATE</h1>
  <h2>World Vision</h2>
  <p>
    World Vision donation goes towards helping the girls in getting education. Many girls living in poverty have to work or marry young instead of getting to study. Others come from families that think education is just for boys. Your gift will help change harmful beliefs, help families earn enough to pay for their daughters’ education, and ensure that girls get to reach for their full potential!
